# MixMax Chain

## Introduction to MixMax Chain
MixMax Chain (MixMax) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high- performance transactions. The endogenous token of MixMax is MC and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism. MixMax will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, Heco's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, MixMax is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## MixMax Performance
- TPS: 2000+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
HPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is MC; the transactions consume MC as gas fee.

Miners pledge MC to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to MixMax by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on MixMax. 

MixMax encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and MixMax will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## MixMax Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.



## Current Stage of MixMax
In May 2022, the MixMax Chain, MixMax officially launched its "Tinder" phase, which will focus on improving the on-chain infrastructure, including but not limited to:
Oracles, Voting tools, Anchor Coins, DEX, Lending, Financial Management, Insurance, Synthetic Assets, Cross-Chain Solutions, Data Analysis, Smart Contract Innovation, etc.
In October 2022, MixMax has now entered the "Spark" phase, which focuses on improving developer and user experience and infrastructure.

## Support Plan of MixMax
### Financial Support
- MixMax will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- MixMax will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on MixMax Dapp, the MixMax meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding MC in a step-wise manner.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from MixMax have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in MixMax global roadshows for free.
- MixMax ventures MixMax fund will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.

### Participate in Test Environment of MixMax



#### Public Testnet
chainid 79


## Risk Warning
- All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of MixMax for free, and there is no charging scenario.
- All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
- MixMax announces authorization, promotion and other collaborations only through the official social media platform. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
